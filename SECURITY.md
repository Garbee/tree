# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The current major version will always get security updates.
In the event a vulnerability affects previous versions, it
will be back-ported to the last major only if it is within
six months of the current major release date.

Beyond that timeframe, any issue will be triaged and
back-porting a fix will be at-will of maintainers only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability you can use the
[Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
system in Github to report it. Any reports
should be triaged in about 7 days. Once
a vulnerability is confirmed, a patch should
be issued within 30 days if the area of impact is within
the scope of this project. Issues that stem from 3rd party
dependencies may take more time to get patched and then
brought into the package here.

Patches will only be applied following our supported versions
guidance in this document.

If a vulnerability is reported and no response is given nor
action taken to progress or communciate on the issue, feel
free to go public after three weeks of the report date.
